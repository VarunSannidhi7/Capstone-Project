PSCS174 -Future Generali Leveraging technology to Improve customer experience Software

Insurance is about building trust relationships with customers and the demand for more transparency is now more than ever. A 
lot of studies have shown that customers care a lot about transparency in
their dealings with the industry â€“clear language, knowing what value they will receive and an open and transparent relationship 
however, the issue is that they seldom read their policy documents carefully and as a result are not completely aware of what 
the relationship entails. Can we build a solution to leverage technology (video, voice, QR) to inform them of most important 
features in a more accessible manner ?
